# --- PersistentVolume for Movies ---
# A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has
# been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned by a StorageClass.
# In this case, we're explicitly defining a PV to point to an existing NFS share.
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: plex-movies-pv # Unique name for this PersistentVolume
spec:
  # The storage capacity that this PV makes available.
  # This should be a realistic (or slightly over) estimate of your NFS share's size.
  # Kubernetes uses this for binding decisions.
  capacity:
    storage: 10Ti # IMPORTANT: Adjust this to your actual storage size for movies, e.g., 20Ti, 500Gi
  # Access modes define how the volume can be mounted.
  # ReadWriteMany (RWX) is typical for NFS, allowing multiple pods/nodes to read/write.
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  # This policy defines what happens to the volume after the PVC that claims it is deleted.
  # 'Retain' means the underlying NFS data (and the PV object) is preserved,
  # preventing accidental data loss. You'd manually clean up if needed.
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  # Specifies the NFS server details for this volume.
  nfs:
    path: /mnt/media/movies # The exact path to the exported share on your TrueNAS server
    server: truenas1-nfs.torquasmvo.internal # The hostname or IP address of your TrueNAS server
  # NFS Mount Options for improved performance and behavior.
  # 'noatime' is particularly useful for media servers as it prevents the OS from
  # writing access times every time a file is read, reducing I/O overhead.
  # 'nfsvers=4.1' specifies NFS protocol version 4.1, often more efficient.
  mountOptions:
    - nfsvers=4.1

# --- PersistentVolumeClaim for Movies ---
# A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user.
# It "claims" a PersistentVolume that meets its criteria (access modes, size).
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: plex-movies-pvc # Unique name for this PersistentVolumeClaim
spec:
  # Defines the access modes requested by the PVC.
  # Must match an access mode supported by the PV it wants to bind to.
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  # The storage size requested by the application.
  # Kubernetes will try to find a PV with at least this much capacity.
  # This should match or be less than the corresponding PV's capacity.
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Ti # IMPORTANT: Match or be less than plex-movies-pv capacity
  # Crucial for binding to manually defined PVs without a StorageClass.
  # An empty string explicitly tells Kubernetes NOT to use a StorageClass
  # (including the default one) for dynamic provisioning, but to bind to a static PV.
